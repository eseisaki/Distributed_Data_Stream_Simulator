# Distributed_Data_Stream_Simulator

A python module for tracking network cost of simulated distributed algorithms.

Using this module, one can implement distributed algorithms at a high level and
simulate them while tracking communication activity.

### Requirements
- implemented with *python: version 3.6 (or higher)*

### Run code

### Run tests

### Documentation

For the documentation **Sphinx 2.3.1.** and **ReadTheDocs** software was used.
