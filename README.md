# Distributed_Data_Stream_Simulator

---

A python module for tracking network cost of simulated distributed algorithms.

Using this module, one can implement distributed algorithms at a high level and
simulate them while tracking communication activity.

---

### Requirements
- implemented with *python: version 3.6 (or higher)*
- it is suggested to create a virtual environment by doing the following:
        
        python3 -m venv venv
